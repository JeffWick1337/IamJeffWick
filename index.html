 Cast your line at the park’s two fishing grounds, A and B, which are open from 7 am–7 pm daily. Ground A is a stretch of rocky banks with benches and man-made shelters; while ground B is a much grassier bank. For your safety, do fish only in designated areas. -<abbr title="National Parks">NParks</abbr>

 Fishing Ground A

<p>This fishing ground is more accessible, more facilitated and bigger than ground B. The bus stop is just less than a minute walk away from the main gate and the carpark is just across the road from it. Ground A has fishing jetty just a few steps in from the main gate. It's very spacious and gives you the extra reach out to the deeper water. The jetty itself also provides cover for fishes such as marbled goby to hide, luring along side of the jetty isn't a bad idea too. But something is missing from the jetty. Shelter! This deters many anglers from fishing on the jetty and many would prefer to fish along the banks because there's shade from the trees along it. Early morning or evening would be a good time to fish on the jetty as the sun isn't that harsh on the hardworking lurers. </p>

<p style="text-align:center">Fishing Ground B </p>

 <p>The second fishing ground is located beside the reservoir's tidal gate. It is a good alternative place to fish if the first one is too crowded, especially during weekends. There are pavillions and benches here too, but there's no paved path. You have to tread on the grass and your feet will be soaked if it rains. It's also a little further to walk from the bus stop and carpark compared to ground A. You can catch more or less the same types of fishes as you can from ground A. Ground B is much smaller than ground A, the fishable area is denoted in the picture below. Despite of its limited space, some regulars believe that B has better catch rate than A. Many people fish here for crayfishes too, its rocky banks are excellent cover for them. </p>
